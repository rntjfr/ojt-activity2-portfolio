                I'm a versatile and dedicated individual with experience in various fields. I began my career in a fastfood chain, developing strong communication and customer service skills. Later, as a Customer Service Representative in a BPO company, I efficiently handled diverse inquiries. In the IT department of a Retail and Distribution Company, and later in a Construction Company, I managed IT operations, including operating systems, security tools, applications, servers, and hardware. I improved systems, supported technologies like Mac OS X, Windows, and Google Workspace, installed and configured software and hardware, maintained networks, ensured security, and provided user training and support. Overall, I am motivated, adaptable, and eager to provide excellent service while continuously expanding my skills.
